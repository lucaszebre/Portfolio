The search in September 2023 was hard and frustrating, but I refused to give up. My persistence paid off. I landed a developer role at Holis, a purpose-driven startup building a SaaS platform for product life-cycle assessments. For the past 14 months, I've been on the 7-person \"root team,\" where theory met reality. Working in a fast-paced, challenging, and sometimes stressful startup environment has been an incredible accelerator. I've moved from an aspiring developer to a professional, mastering production-level Git workflows, rigorous coding practices, and the resilience required to add features and solve complex bugs on a live product."

        "title": "Current Ambitions: Polyvalence and Creation",
        "content": "My 14 months at Holis have only deepened my curiosity. My plan is to continue growing with the team while simultaneously starting a Bachelor's degree in Network Systems and Cloud at ESGI. In a world being rapidly reshaped by AI, I believe polyvalence is the key to the future. I want to understand the entire ecosystem—from DevOps and cloud architecture down to the software itself. This drive to \"build stuff\" is stronger than ever, pushing me to start my journey as an \"indie hacker\" and, unlike many developers, actually finish my side projects. I recently completed a pet-oriented chatbot, leveraging the Gemini API and careful prompting to keep it on track."

        "title": "Competitive Spirit",
        "content": "I've always had a competitive spirit, cultivated through years of sports like basketball, football, and surfing. But my true parallel for development is skateboarding. It's my go-to way to challenge myself, focus intently, and learn new things—progressing every day, falling, and getting hurt. It might sound masochistic, but I love it for a reason: in skateboarding, you always fail before you land a trick. I think it's the same in life and in code. This metaphor felt especially real recently. After a significant injury, I just got back on my board this summer. The process wasn't just about competition; it was about patience, recovery, and finding mental and physical peace. It reinforced my core belief: whether you're recovering from a fall or navigating a high-stress bug at a startup, the most important thing is that you stay consistent and keep trying smartly."
